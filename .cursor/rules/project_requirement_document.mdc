# Product Requirements Document: Doctor Acquisition CRM (MVP with AI)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 3, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a web-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application. The primary purpose of this MVP is to streamline lead management for the sales team focused on acquiring doctors for our medical applications. This MVP will specifically cover the "Leads to Conversion" journey, incorporating foundational AI-powered capabilities from day one.

## 2. Business Goals

The single, primary business goal of this CRM MVP is to **streamline lead management for the sales team** to efficiently convert doctor leads into committed users of our medical app.

A successful MVP at launch will enable the sales team to **log approximately 5-10 leads per day per sales representative**, and for Sales Admins to effectively monitor the conversion funnel.

## 3. Scope (In & Out of MVP)

### 3.1 In Scope (MVP)

* **User Management:** Sales Representative and Sales Admin roles with defined permissions.
* **Lead Management:**
    * Lead creation (manual, form capture, bulk upload).
    * Comprehensive lead data fields.
    * Defined lead statuses and strict transition rules.
    * Detailed activity logging (calls, emails, WhatsApp, in-person meetings).
    * Task and reminder management.
* **AI-Powered Add-ons:**
    * Deal Coach AI (AI-generated next steps).
    * Customer Persona Builder (AI-generated behavioral profiles).
    * Objection Handler Recommender (AI-suggested responses).
    * Win-Loss Explainer (AI-explained deal outcomes).
    * **Note:** These AI features will leverage LLM APIs and operate on initial dummy data (200 records). AI model retraining will be a manual process and is not part of the MVP.
* **Reporting:** Key sales funnel metrics for Sales Admins.
* **User Interface (UI):** Desktop web application.
* **Basic Authentication:** Username/Password login.

### 3.2 Out of Scope (MVP)

The following functionalities are **explicitly out of scope** for this MVP and will be considered in future iterations:

* Doctor Onboarding workflows within the CRM.
* Doctor Support/Ticketing system.
* Direct billing integration.
* Marketing automation beyond simple lead capture forms.
* "Forgot Password" functionality for user authentication.
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* In-app/email notifications for overdue tasks.
* CRM integration with existing Doctor App or User App.
* Direct email integration (sending/logging replies automatically).
* WhatsApp API integration for sending automated messages (logging is in scope).
* Data backup strategy for the CRM database (as per current decision, though highly discouraged).
* Sales Reps submitting new objections/successful responses to improve AI knowledge base.
* Automated AI model retraining pipeline.
* Mobile application (iOS/Android) beyond responsive web view.

## 4. Target Users & Roles

The primary users of this CRM MVP are internal sales team members.

* **Sales Representative (5-10 users):**
    * **Permissions:** Create, View, Edit, Log Activities for assigned leads.
    * **Dashboard:** View personal tasks and lead status overview.
* **Sales Admin/Manager (1-2 users):**
    * **Permissions:** Create, View, Edit, Assign any lead. View all reports. Access all AI features.
    * **Dashboard:** View team-level metrics and overall conversion funnel.

    * A lead status can **only move from a lower level to a higher level**.
        * Example: "Demo Scheduled" (Level 3) cannot transition back to "Contacted - Interested" (Level 2).
    * A lead can change status **within the same level**.
        * Example: "Post-Demo Follow-up" can be changed to "Objections Being Addressed."
    * **Transition to "Lost" (Level 6):** A lead can only transition to "Lost" from either:

### 5.2 AI-Powered Add-ons (Leveraging LLM APIs)

**General AI Implementation Notes:**
* AI features will primarily rely on external LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.).
* Initial functionality will be achieved by prompting these APIs with current lead data and predefined rules/dummy data.
* AI model retraining based on new data will be a manual process outside the MVP's scope.
* **Initial Data for AI:** The CRM will be seeded with approximately **200 dummy records** (leads with varied statuses, activities, and notes) to enable basic AI functionality from day one.

#### 5.2.1 Deal Coach AI

* **Functionality:** Upon clicking a dedicated button ("Get AI Coach Advice") on a lead's profile, the AI will suggest the next best steps to improve close probability.
* **Parameters for AI Consideration (Initial):** Lead Status, time in current status, number of interactions, identified pain points, Sales Rep's prior activities (to avoid suggesting already completed steps).
* **Output:** Concise, actionable recommendations for the next step.
    * **Examples of Next Steps:** "Schedule a demo," "Send pricing details," "Address 'cost' objection," "Follow-up via WhatsApp."

#### 5.2.2 Customer Persona Builder

* **Functionality:** Upon clicking a dedicated button ("Generate Customer Persona") on a lead's profile, the AI will auto-generate a behavioral profile.

* **Interaction History Priority:** Notes from calls and physical meetings, content of emails, WhatsApp chats.
* **Sparse Data Handling:** If interaction history is sparse for a new lead, the AI should display a "Basic persona based on specialty/city data only" (or similar default, non-null message if no data exists).

#### 5.2.3 Objection Handler Recommender

* **Functionality:** A dedicated module or field where Sales Reps can paste a customer objection, and the AI suggests convincing responses.
* **Knowledge Base:** Will be populated initially by a predefined list of common objections and ideal responses provided by the product team.
* **Output Format:** A list of **3 bullet points** suggesting responses.

#### 5.2.4 Win-Loss Explainer

* **Functionality:** Located within the "Reports" section, this AI will explain patterns in why deals were won or lost.
* **Factors for AI Consideration:** Lead Source, Number of Interactions, Time to Convert, Specific Pain Points/Objections raised, Sales Rep involved.
* **Output Format:** A summary paragraph, followed by bullet points of key contributing factors for wins and separate bullet points for losses.
* **Minimum Threshold for Insights (MVP):** The AI should attempt to provide insights even with a **single won/lost deal** (though quality will improve with volume). It should clearly state if insights are limited due to low data.

## 6. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

    * Adhere to relevant Indian IT laws, specifically the **IT Act, 2000**, for professional data handling and secure coding practices.

## 8. Future Considerations (Briefly Mentioned in PRD)

The CRM's architecture should be designed with future expansion in mind to accommodate modules such as:
* Comprehensive doctor onboarding workflows.
* Integrated doctor support/ticketing system.
* Enhanced AI capabilities (e.g., automated AI model retraining, more sophisticated predictive analytics).
